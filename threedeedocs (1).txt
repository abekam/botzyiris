Introduction
Zebra  Iris GTX combines the integration of a conventional smart camera with
the flexibility of a traditional PC-based machine vision system. Zebra  Iris GTX
is a fully programmable device, allowing extensive customization. Zebra 
Iris GTX comes pre-installed with the Zebra  Design Assistant runtime
environment.
Zebra  Design Assistant is an intuitive, flowchart-based, integrated development
environment (IDE). System integrators and professional end-users can easily and
quickly develop and deploy machine vision applications on a highly integrated
platform without the need for traditional programming skills. The integrated
development environment provides access to a comprehensive set of
highly-efficient and field-proven image analysis and measurement tools.
Zebra  Iris GTX features an Intel-architecture processor, and uses a global shutter
CMOS image sensor from a range of monochrome and color options. The CMOS
image sensor allows the exposure phase of a triggered grab to occur while the
previous image is being transferred. The Intel-architecture processor is an Intel
Atom x6211E processor. The 32-Gbyte eMMC (flash disk) provides in-camera
(on-board) storage for both the operating system and additional data. 4 Gbytes
of LPDDR4x SDRAM provides in-camera (on-board) volatile storage.
Zebra  Iris GTX is fully integrated in an IP67 enclosure, eliminating the need to
separately source a sealed camera housing, while still providing easy access to the
lens.

Introduction 9
Zebra  Iris GTX can connect to a display device through the VGA/USB
connector and it can communicate with other devices through the Gigabit
Ethernet network interface (100/1000 BaseT) and digital auxiliary I/O signals.
An advanced I/O engine is included to allow you to communicate and coordinate
events using the auxiliary I/O signals (for example, to trigger and set the duration
of the exposure).
The network interface can be used for general purpose, Gigabit network
communication, or for communication with external devices using the
PROFINET, EtherNet/IP, CCLink, or Modbus industrial protocols. For
PROFINET communication on the network interface, Zebra  Iris GTX provides
a PROFINET engine with a hardware-assisted PROFINET interface. The
hardware-assisted interface supports a minimum I/O cycle time of 1 msec.

Software overview
The Zebra  Iris GTX with Design Assistant is distributed with Zebra  Design
Assistant, a flowchart-based, integrated development environment (IDE). It
allows you to create an imaging application without writing a single line of code.
Application development is a step-by-step approach, where each step is taken from
an existing toolbox and is configured through a series of dialog windows. Zebra 
Design Assistant runs on your development computer and uses the resources of
your Zebra  Iris GTX smart camera (for example, to grab an image and
communicate with connected devices) to build projects. Once the project is built,
it runs on your Zebra  Iris GTX without relying on the resources of your
development computer.
With Zebra  Design Assistant, you can:
(cid:129) Create your project as a series of steps using a flowchart.
(cid:129) Test your project from your computer without any additional code editors or
compilers and without deploying (copying and running) your project on your

The Zebra  Iris GTX has the following interfaces (from left to right):
(cid:129) Digital I/O and power connector. Used to receive power from an external power
source. The connector can also receive trigger input and send/receive digital
auxiliary I/O signals to/from third-party I/O devices. In addition, the connector
has a specialized analog intensity (dimming) control signal intended to be used
with a lighting device (such as, an Advanced Illumination inline control system
(ICS3), a Smart Vision Lights Brick light, or a similar device).
(cid:129) VGA/USB connector. Provides connectivity between your Zebra  Iris GTX and
a display device and/or a USB device (such as a keyboard or a mouse).
(cid:129) 100/1000 BaseT Ethernet connector. Provides connectivity between your
Zebra  Iris GTX and your computer or your network. Zebra  Iris GTX can gain
access to a LAN via Gbit Ethernet (GigE, 1G BaseT, or 1000BaseT), fast Ethernet
(100BaseT), or twisted pair Ethernet (10BaseT). This interface can also be used
for communication with external devices using the PROFINET, EtherNet I/P,
CCLink, or Modbus protocol. For PROFINET, the interface operates as a
hardware-assisted PROFINET interface. The LAN connection associated with
the hardware-assisted PROFINET interface can be shared with other traffic.

Adding Zebra  Iris GTX to your network
Corporate-wide networks typically use DHCP servers to assign each connected
device an IP address. If your Zebra  Iris GTX is still in its factory-configured state,
and your network uses a DHCP server, no configuration is required to use your
Zebra  Iris GTX on your network.
Much of the information found in this section is directed to users with a Zebra 
Iris GTX camera with Zebra  Design Assistant, because in this case, the camera
uses the Zebra  Imaging Operating System (MIOS).
Device name (AUTO NETNAME)
By default, Zebra  Iris GTX comes factory configured with a device name
(AUTO NETNAME), which can be found on a sticker attached to your Zebra 
Iris GTX smart camera and is unique for each camera. If you are connecting to a
static network, use the IP address of the camera; otherwise, if you are connected
to a DHCP network, this name is used:
GTXxxxxxx
The xxxxxx corresponds to the six hexadecimal digits of your Zebra  Iris GTX’s
MAC address. This can be changed to a more meaningful name through the
Zebra  Design Assistant configuration portal.
The Zebra  Design Assistant configuration portal on your Zebra  Iris GTX is
located at http:\\GTXxxxxxx, where GTXxxxxxx is your smart camera’s device
name. This portal allows you to manage many aspects of your smart camera (for
example, configure settings, manage projects, and set up communication). You
can change network settings in the TCP/IP tab of the Administration page (gear
icon), where you can also change the device name (AUTO NETNAME) of your
camera.
Using a static IP address with networks that do not use DHCP
If your network does not use DHCP, you must access and configure your Zebra 
Iris GTX to use a static IP address. To access Zebra  Iris GTX when you don’t
know its current IP address, you can physically connect to it or use the Zebra 
System Discovery (MtxSysDiscovery) utility on your development computer.

Accessing your Zebra  Iris GTX desktop remotely
If you do not want to keep a keyboard, mouse, and monitor connected to your
Zebra  Iris GTX, once your smart camera is on your network, you can connect
to your Zebra  Iris GTX remotely by using a virtual network computing (VNC)
program. Several VNC programs are available on the Internet. A few choice
examples are available to download directly from your smart camera. To download
and install one of these programs, perform the following:
1. For Zebra  Iris GTX with Design Assistant users, go to the following web address:
http:\\GTXxxxxxx:8080
Replace xxxxxx with the six digits of your smart camera’s MAC address, or if you
have changed the camera’s device name, replace GTXxxxxxx with its new name.
You can also replace GTXxxxxxx with the smart camera’s IP address.
2. Select the installer that best matches your needs.
Follow all on-screen instructions. Refer to the provided documentation for
assistance.
3. Before using the installed VPN, you must first enable Auto logon in the Zebra 
Design Assistant portal.

Connecting to the auxiliary I/O interface
Zebra  Iris GTX has an auxiliary I/O interface with 7 optically isolated auxiliary
signals. Four are inputs that support sinking and sourcing configurations and can
receive 24 V. Three are outputs that support sinking configurations and operate
at up to 24 V nominal; you could connect one of the outputs in a sourcing
configuration, but the other two outputs would no longer be available. Zebra 
Iris GTX also has an analog intensity (dimming) control signal, which is discussed
in the Connecting a light controller and the analog intensity control signal section
later in this chapter.
Note that sinking and sourcing concepts refer to the conventional current flow,
which means current flows from the positive potential towards the negative
potential. A sinking device provides a path to sink current towards ground or to
the return path; a sinking device does not provide power. A sourcing device
provides a path that sources current; it provides a path from the power source. In
the following diagram, the device on the right is the sourcing device, and the device
on the left is the sinking device.

Connecting devices to the auxiliary output signals
Zebra  Iris GTX auxiliary output signals can be interfaced with input modules
(with sourcing or sinking input signals) found on most programmable logic
controllers (PLCs) and other devices. The auxiliary output signals can also be
interfaced with inductive load devices (such as a relay or a small motor).
The Zebra  Iris GTX auxiliary output signals are sinking output signals, based
on an NPN-type transistor. They need to be connected to an external power source
because on their own, they are not capable of providing voltage to drive a device.
They are typically connected in a sinking configuration because they only have
one dedicated pin (AUX_OUT0, AUX_OUT1, AUX_OUT2, respectively) and
share their other pin (AUX_OUT_COMMON). So, typically, a sourcing device
is connected to their dedicated pin and the return path is connected to the
common pin. The exact connection between the output signal, the connected
device, and the power source depends on the type of device to which you connect.

Page 32
32 Chapter 2: Powering and connecting to your Zebra  Iris GTX
To add pullup or pull-down circuitry, attach an external pullup or pull-down
resistor, respectively. A resistance value of 3 KOhms is suggested to protect your
Zebra  Iris GTX. Since your Zebra  Iris GTX auxiliary output signals can sink
up to 50 mA, use the documentation of your input to calculate the required
resistance for your external pullup/pull-down resistor (if necessary).
In the connections above, the pullup circuitry causes an inversion if the input of
the device is connected to the AUX_OUT pin. When the auxiliary output signal
is on, the circuit between its AUX_OUT and AUX_OUT_COMMON pins is
closed, and current flows from the power source to the AUX_OUT_COMMON
pin. So the observed voltage at the AUX_OUT pin will be low. Whereas, when
the auxiliary output signal is off, the circuit between its AUX_OUT and
AUX_OUT_COMMON pins is open, and current flows from the power source
to the input of the device. In this state, the current is limited by the pullup’s resistor
value.
Warning The Zebra  Iris GTX auxiliary output signals are compatible with voltages up to
24 V. However, by default, the auxiliary output signals offer low resistance. When
they are on (their circuit is closed), current flows directly through them. Ensure
that the circuit created between the power source, the output signal, the connected
device, and return path does not cause more than 50 mA to flow through the
signal.
As a precaution, the auxiliary output signals are individually fuse-protected up to
50 mA. Zebra  Iris GTX uses resettable fuses. The fuses protect Zebra  Iris GTX
if you accidentally connect their corresponding auxiliary output signal to a device
that sources/sinks more current than Zebra  Iris GTX can safely transmit. If more
than 50 mA of current goes through your Zebra  Iris GTX, the fuse will
eventually trip. After disconnecting your Zebra  Iris GTX, the fuse will reset only
after it has sufficiently cooled,

Connecting devices to the auxiliary input signals
Zebra  Iris GTX auxiliary input signals can be interfaced with a wide variety of
devices (such as proximity detectors). The Zebra  Iris GTX auxiliary input signals
only detect when current flows between their AUX_IN pin and
AUX_IN_COMMON pin. As such, an auxiliary input signal must be connected
to a device that controls the flow of current. When current is detected, the signal
is reported as on; otherwise, it is reported as off. In software, you can enable an
interrupt to be generated the moment current is detected. For information on the
electrical specifications of the on and off voltage levels, see the Electrical
specifications section, in Appendix B: Technical reference.
Each of the four available auxiliary input signals has one dedicated pin (AUX_IN3,
AUX_IN4, AUX_IN5, and AUX_IN6, respectively) and shares its other pin
(AUX_IN_COMMON) with the other auxiliary input signals.
You can connect the auxiliary input signals in a sinking or sourcing configuration.
Since the auxiliary input signals share a common pin, they have to be all in a
sinking configuration or all in a sourcing configuration. The exact connection
between the input signal, the connected device, and the power source depends
entirely on the type of device to which you connect. You should essentially connect
your device respecting the following:

Connecting to the auxiliary I/O interface 39
Pullup circuitry In some cases, you must add pullup circuitry to connect an output device to an
auxiliary input signal; specifically, you must attach an external pullup resistor
between the voltage source and the AUX_IN pin.
This is required when you connect the AUX_IN_COMMON pin to the electrical
return path and the third-party output device is in a sinking configuration. In this
case, select a resistor value that will not overcurrent the output device and instead
provide just enough current and voltage to your Zebra  Iris GTX auxiliary input
signals, according to the Electrical specifications subsection in
Appendix B: Technical reference. Note that you should use a resistor with an
appropriate power rating for your circuit.

Bleeding resistor By default, if properly configured, the current should flow from the AUX_IN pin
to the AUX_IN_COMMON pin (when connected to a sourcing device), or from
the AUX_IN_COMMON pin to the AUX_IN pin (when connected to a sinking
device). In some cases, the amount of current going through the sensing circuit is
insufficient for the connected output device to match its minimum current
requirement when the device is in an on or off-state, depending on the
configuration of the circuit. To boost the flowing current, connect a 2.2 kOhm
external bleeder resistor between the AUX_IN and AUX_IN_COMMON pins.

Connecting a 2-wire proximity sensor to an auxiliary input signal
You can connect a 2-wire proximity sensor to a Zebra  Iris GTX auxiliary input
signal in either a sourcing or sinking configuration (that is, on a positive or negative
power wire). Note that in both cases, you will need to install an external bleeder
resistor, to ensure that a minimum amount of current flows into the proximity
sensor in its on-state and in its off-state.
(cid:129) For the auxiliary input signal to source the current (that is, to connect an auxiliary
input signal on a positive power wire), connect the 2-wire device to the auxiliary

Connecting a light controller and the analog intensity control signal 47
Connecting a light controller and the analog
intensity control signal
Zebra  Iris GTX includes an auxiliary I/O engine, with an analog intensity
control signal (AUX_AREF_OUT7), which provides a slow changing analog
intensity (dimming) control signal from 0-10 VDC. This control signal can be
used to set the intensity for a light controller (for example, with an Advanced
Illumination inline control system or Smart Vision Lights brick light); however,
it should not be used to draw any current or drive power.
To set the intensity of the light controller using Zebra  Design Assistant, chose
Physical Camera under the Cameras item of the Platform configuration dialog,
and enter a value for Intensity. See the Grab and auxiliary I/O overview section of
the Zebra  Iris GTX appendix in the Zebra  Design Assistant help file for more
information.
Connect the lighting controller’s intensity pin directly to the analog intensity
control pin (AUX_AREF_OUT7). The following examples show how to connect
Zebra  Iris GTX to the trigger and intensity pins of your lighting controller.

Connecting a sourcing light controller (NPN pin)
If your lighting controller has an NPN pin (sourcing input signal), it expects to
be connected in an NPN topology, whereby the connected, controlling auxiliary
output signal sinks the current and the input pin sources the current. To do so,
connect the sourcing light controller to an auxiliary output signal and the analog
intensity control signal (AUX_AREF_OUT7) of Zebra  Iris GTX as shown
below1.

(cid:129) Auxiliary signal.
An auxiliary signal is a user-defined I/O signal that can have one or more additional
functions. For example, a signal that can be both a trigger signal and a user-defined
input signal, is an auxiliary signal.
• IP67 enclosure.
An IP67 enclosure is a specific type of industrial enclosure that is dust and
water-tight. The name is derived using the incarnation protection rating (or
ingress protection code), and defined in the international standard IEC 60529.
(cid:129) Sinking.
A DC circuit that provides the common reference (low) for the circuit. In the case
of your Zebra  Iris GTX, determining whether the connection is sinking or
sourcing determines how to connect the auxiliary input common signal and
auxiliary output common signal, respectively.
(cid:129) Sourcing.
A DC circuit that provides the voltage needed for the circuit. In the case of your
Zebra  Iris GTX, determining whether the connection is sinking or sourcing
determines how to connect the auxiliary input common signal and auxiliary
output common signal, respectively.

CPU board
The CPU board of Zebra  Iris GTX has the following features:
(cid:129) SOC/CPU: Atom x6211E processor.
(cid:129) Volatile memory: 4 Gbytes of LPDDR4x SDRAM.
(cid:129) Non-volatile memory: 32 Gbytes of flash disk (eMMC) memory.
(cid:129) Networking: One 100/1000 Mbits (or 100 Mbit/1 Gbit) Ethernet networking
interface. This interface can be used for communicating with external devices
using the PROFINET, EtherNetI/P, CCLink, or Modbus protocol. For
PROFINET, Zebra  Iris GTX provides a hardware-assisted PROFINET interface
that support a minimum I/O cycle time of 1 msec. When using the
hardware-assisted PROFINET interface, it will create a second Ethernet
communication device with its own independent MAC address and IP
settings.The LAN connection associated with the hardware-assisted PROFINET
interface can be shared with other traffic.
(cid:129) An advanced I/O engine that includes the following:
- Digital I/Os: 4 inputs and 3 outputs.
❯ 4 opto-isolated, digital auxiliary input signals (24V).
❯ Input signals have interrupt generation capabilities.
❯ Input signals can sink or source. To source voltage, you must connect an
auxiliary voltage source to the common input signal
(AUX_OPTOIND_IN_COMMON). For voltage expectations, see
Electrical specifications subsection of the Zebra  Iris GTX specifications
section, later in this appendix. Whether all the input signals are sinking or
sourcing is dependent upon the connection of the common input signal.
❯ Input signals are debounced (that is, configured to wait a given amount of
time between accepting a signal change). The debouncing time can be
configured using Zebra  Design Assistant. For more information, refer to
the Zebra  Design Assistant help file.

❯ 3 opto-isolated auxiliary output signals (up to 24 V). Note that these
auxiliary output signals are sinking signals that share a common signal. If
one of these signals is used as a sourcing signal, the other two are no longer
available.
- One analog output. A 0-10 V signal designed to connect to the 0-10 V analog
intensity control pin of a light controller (such as, an Advanced Illumination
inline control system (ICS3), a Smart Vision Lights Brick light, or a similar
device). This signal does not provide power; instead, it provides analog intensity
(dimming) control (0-10 V translates to 0-100% illumination).
- Timers.1 exposure, 1 strobe, 8 general purpose.
❯ 1 exposure timer. A 28-bit timer used to control the exposure of your Zebra 
Iris GTX, and allows a range of exposure time from 50 usec to 4 sec. The
timer output will always set camera exposure, but can be simultaneously
redirected to any auxiliary output signal.
❯ 1 strobe timer. A 28-bit timer whose output can be routed to any auxiliary
output signal. The resulting output signal can then be used to control a strobe
device. This timer is limited by the maximum possible value for the exposure
timer, and when the exposure timer ends, so will the strobe timer.
❯ 8 general timers. Each of the timers (Timer 1 through 8) is a 32-bit timer
and can count up to 4,294,967,295 clock ticks before resetting. Each timer
can use a specified clock source for its active period and a different specified
clock source for its delay period.
- One I/O command list. Used to schedule I/O commands, in any order.
- One rotary decoder. Supports input from rotary encoders with quadrature
output.

Zebra  Imaging operating system utilities
Zebra  Iris GTX includes several useful utilities. They are available from the
following web address:
http:\\GTXxxxxxx:8080
In the above example, replace xxxxxx with the six digits of your smart camera’s
MAC address. If you have changed the camera’s device name, replace GTXxxxxxx
with the name of your smart camera, or use its IP address; for more information,
see Connecting to your Zebra  Iris GTX desktop section, in Chapter 2: Powering and
connecting to your Zebra  Iris GTX.
Note that these utilities are stored on your Zebra  Iris GTX, but should be
installed on your development computer, in case the operating system partition
becomes corrupt and you need to use these programs. They can be downloaded
from your Zebra  Iris GTX’s web address, shown at the top of this section.
The utilities offered are as follows:
(cid:129) Virtual network computing (VNC). This utility allow you to remotely connect
to your Zebra  Iris GTX.
(cid:129) Zebra  System Discovery (MtxSysDiscovery) utility. This 64-bit Windows
utility allows you to discover Zebra  Iris GTX cameras on your network. In
addition, it can change network settings, restart or shut down individual smart
cameras, or open the portal page of a specific camera. On computers with Zebra 
Design Assistant installed, this utility is included in the Tools folder, accessible
from the MIL Control Center.
(cid:129) Bonjour browser. This is a link to the Internet that leads to the Bonjour browser
website. Bonjour browser is a program that lists all the services on your subnet.
This provides a way to find the IP address of any Zebra  Iris GTX on the subnet.

Upgrading the Zebra  Imaging operating system 75
(cid:129) FileZilla. A client utility for transferring files from one computer to another using
FTP, FTPS, or SFTP.
(cid:129) Putty. A client console utility for running remote sessions on a computer over a
network using the SSH (Secure Shell), Telnet, or Rlogin network protocols.
(cid:129) Rufus. A utility that formats and creates bootable USB keys.
Upgrading the Zebra  Imaging operating
system
If you have upgraded Zebra  Design Assistant, you might be required to update
the version of the Zebra  Imaging operating system (MIOS) on Zebra  Iris GTX.
You can configure the MILConfig utility on your development computer to
receive updates. You can then use this update to upgrade the camera.
Warning An upgrade will erase all information on the Zebra  Iris GTX storage drive. If
you have made changes to a deployed project from its operator view, it is
recommended that in Zebra  Design Assistant, you synchronize recipes between
the runtime and the design time project. Also, import all recipes that you created
at runtime, copy all image folders that are stored on Zebra  Iris GTX, and back
up any validation sets that you need to continue using after the upgrade.
To upgrade the Zebra  Imaging operating system (MIOS) on your Zebra 
Iris GTX, perform the following:
1. Connect remotely to your Zebra  Iris GTX from Zebra  Design Assistant.
Zebra  Design Assistant will detect a version mismatch and prompt you to
upgrade. When you accept this prompt, an Update dialog will appear.
2. In the Update dialog, browse to the location on your development computer
where MILConfig stored the new MIOS ISO file (.iso). This is generally in the
same location as where your Zebra  Design Assistant upgrade package is stored.
3. Once the MIOS ISO file has been selected, click on the Update button in the
Update dialog and your update will begin.
The ISO file will be copied to Zebra  Iris GTX; then, the camera will power cycle.
Upon power cycling, the camera is upgraded.

76 Appendix C: Zebra  Imaging operating system utilities and recovery
To apply an MIOS upgrade on several smart cameras, it might be more efficient
to upgrade from a USB key, connected to the smart camera’s VGA/USB connector,
through a GTR-CBL-VGAUSB cable. To do so, you will need to install the MIOS
upgrade on one smart camera, back it up on a USB key, and then deploy it on the
other smart cameras. See the Making a backup MIOS and deploying it on multiple
units section, later in this appendix.
Restoring the Zebra  Imaging operating
system to factory defaults
If required, you can restore the Zebra  Imaging operating system to the factory
default using the MIOS ISO stored in the recovery partition on your Zebra 
Iris GTX, or you can restore it from a USB key with a factory default MIOS ISO.
Restoring the factory default MIOS
The factory default version of the MIOS ISO is stored on the Zebra  Iris GTX
recovery partition. To recover the factory default version, perform the following:
1. Connect a monitor, mouse, and keyboard to your Zebra  Iris GTX, as described
in Chapter 2: Powering and connecting to your Zebra  Iris GTX.
2. Reboot your Zebra  Iris GTX.

Making a backup MIOS and deploying it on
multiple units
If you have updated settings or made specific changes to your MIOS that you
would like to use on other units, you will need to make a backup MIOS ISO.
This backup is stored in the recovery partition of Zebra  Iris GTX. This MIOS
ISO cannot be mounted onto a USB key; it can only be stored on one.
Alternatively, you can store this backup on your network. Once a backup is saved,
it can be deployed on a unit by following the instructions outlined in the
subsections below.
Saving a backup MIOS
To create a backup MIOS ISO that you can use in the event that your drive ever
corrupts, you should store it on a blank USB key with a capacity of 4 Gbytes, or
more. To do so:
1. Follow steps 1-4 of the Restoring the factory default MIOS section earlier in this
appendix.
2. On the Zebra  Imaging OS - Recovery page, select Backup System Disk.
A terminal will open and start the process of creating a backup MIOS ISO. The
ISO file will be stored in the boot/backup/rescue folder of your
Zebra  Iris GTX unit.

Tables:
==== Page Separator ====

Page 87
Making a backup MIOS and deploying it on multiple units 87
3. When the process completes, you will get a message that the backup completed
successfully. Click on OK, and manually reboot your unit.
4. You can now store this backup MIOS ISO on a USB key or somewhere on your
network.
Deploying a backup MIOS to the same unit on which it was created
Once you have made a backup MIOS ISO, you can now deploy this backup if
you need to restore the unit. To deploy the backup MIOS ISO, perform the
following:
1. Reboot your Zebra  Iris GTX.
2. Near the end of the BIOS boot process, after the BIOS logo appears, a
monochrome screen presents you with three options, instead of two: load the
current MIOS, load the recovery ISO, or load the backup ISO. Use your keyboard
to select the latter.

Tables:
==== Page Separator ====

Page 88
88 Appendix C: Zebra  Imaging operating system utilities and recovery
3. After selecting to load the backup ISO, your unit will restart. Do not change the
selection on the monochrome screen; eventually, the unit will present the login
screen, ask for the default password, and then present the Zebra  Imaging OS -
Backup page. To complete the deployment of the backup on the system disk, select
the Install to system disk option.
Deploying a backup MIOS to a different unit
With a backup MIOS ISO saved either on a USB key or somewhere on your
network, you can deploy the backup MIOS ISO to multiple units that require the
same settings as the backup MIOS ISO. To deploy the backup MIOS ISO to
multiple units, perform the following:
1. Locate the backup MIOS ISO and copy it to a known location on the Zebra 
Iris GTX unit that you will be restoring.
2. Open the Linux command terminal and use setrescue.sh backup to install the
backup MIOS ISO onto the recovery partition.
3. Reboot the Zebra  Iris GTX unit.

Updating the Zebra  Iris GTX BIOS 91
Updating the Zebra  Iris GTX BIOS
After upgrading the operating system, you should verify that you have the most
up-to-date BIOS version before beginning.
Important If you do not have the correct BIOS version, it will cause a problem with your
Zebra  Iris GTX. The BIOS version is displayed on the Essential Information
page of the Zebra  Design Assistant configuration portal; on this page, you can
also see if there are new BIOS versions available.
Updating the BIOS is a delicate operation that requires user-intervention to ensure
it is executed without interruption. Note that if a power failure occurs during the
BIOS update process, your Zebra  Iris GTX will have to be sent to Zebra  for
repair.
To update the BIOS, perform the following:
1. Access the Zebra  Iris GTX desktop. To do so, you can either:
(cid:129) Connect directly using a local display and mouse-keyboard connection. To
connect a local display, mouse, and keyboard, see the Powering and connecting
to your Zebra  Iris GTX section, in Chapter 2: Powering and connecting to your
Zebra  Iris GTX.
(cid:129) Connect remotely via a VNC client, Putty, or through Microsoft Windows
telnet. To find a VCN client or Putty, follow the instructions in the Zebra 
Imaging operating system utilities section, earlier in this appendix.
2. If you are connecting with a VNC client, once the Zebra  Iris GTX desktop is
displayed, open a terminal window by clicking on the Activities menu command
and then the Terminal icon. When using Putty, you are presented immediately
with the terminal window.
Note that you must have Auto logon enabled in the Zebra  Design Assistant portal
in order to connect to a VNC client. This is found on the AUTO LOGON tab
of the DEVICE portal page. See the Zebra  Design Assistant documentation for
more information.

92 Appendix C: Zebra  Imaging operating system utilities and recovery
3. Inside the terminal window, go to the /opt/BIOS folder using the following
commands:
cd /opt
cd BIOS
 Note that MIOS is case-sensitive.
4. Start the BIOS update application using the following command:
sudo ./IRISGTX_<BIOSVERSION>.bin
where you should replace <BIOSVERSION> with the new BIOS version (for
example, IrisGTX_100002.bin). The BIOS update starts after a 10-second delay.
Once the BIOS update begins, information will appear on your local display.
5. When the BIOS update completes, you will be prompted to reboot Zebra 
Iris GTX. Changes made will not take effect until you reboot.
